httpd
=====================

The httpd module breaks down Apache configuration into "websites" (which
roughly translates to a virtualhosts).

For example, admin.fedoraproject.org is a website, and the ::proxy blocks
for various applications such as FAS, bodhi, pkgdb, etc. tie them to the
website that they are on.  To see where the links between websites and web
applications live in puppet, see manifests/servergroups/proxy.pp.

Apart from websites, some defines are provided for common things such as
redirects, SSL certificates, etc.
